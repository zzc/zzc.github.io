## Build Setup

Install dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

Serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
```bash
yarn dev
```

Build for production and launch server
```bash
yarn run build
yarn start
```

Generate static project
```bash
yarn run generate
```

## Notes

You must push dist to the `master` branch, because Github don't want to serve things for organizations from other branches/locations.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
